# Riddley - Harry Potter's Magical AI Diary

Riddley is a delightful iOS app that recreates the magical experience of Tom Riddle's diary from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Using Claude's advanced AI capabilities, it creates an engaging and interactive journaling experience where the diary responds to your entries with wit and charm, just like Tom Riddle's diary responded to Harry Potter.

*"When in doubt, I suggest you follow the spiders... or in this case, the code."* 

## ‚ö°Ô∏è About The Project

Riddley is an experimental prototype that attempts to recreate the magical experience of Tom Riddle's diary from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Using Claude's AI capabilities, it creates an interactive diary that responds to your writings, much like how Tom Riddle's diary responded to Harry.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Prototype Status**: This is currently a half-baked prototype that needs more magical enhancement. It's a proof of concept waiting for fellow Potterheads with coding skills to transform it into something truly magical!

## ü™Ñ Current Features

- Interactive journaling where the diary responds to your writings
- iPad-optimized interface for that authentic book-writing feel
- AI-powered responses using Claude (our attempt at magical intelligence!)
- Basic conversation capabilities

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What Could Be Added

- Handwriting recognition for a more authentic experience
- Ink-appearing animation effects like in the movies
- Voice interactions
- AR features to make the diary appear more magical
- Memory viewing capabilities (similar to how the diary showed Harry the memories)
- Dark mode for those late-night writing sessions in the Gryffindor common room

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. Obtain Your "Wand" (Claude API Key):
   - Visit [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com/)
   - Sign up for an account and obtain your API key
   
2. Cast Your First Spell (Add API Key):
   - Open `Riddley/Config.swift`
   - Replace the empty string in `claudeApiKey` with your actual API key:
     ```swift
     static let claudeApiKey = "your-api-key-here"
     ```

## üì± Requirements

- iOS/iPadOS 15.0 or later
- Xcode 13.0 or later
- Claude API key
- No prior knowledge of Defense Against the Dark Arts required

## ü§ù Contributing

This prototype needs fellow wizards and witches who can help transform it into a fully-functional magical artifact! If you're a Potter fan with iOS development skills, your contributions would be most welcome. Feel free to fork, enhance, and send those owl posts (pull requests).

## üìú Privacy & Security

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Keep your API key more secret than the Chamber of Secrets itself. Never commit it to version control!
